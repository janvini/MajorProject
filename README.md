# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on sentiment analysis using a Naive Bayes classifier. The model is designed to classify customer reviews as either positive or negative based on the content of the reviews. The project includes steps such as data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.


## Installation

To run the notebook, the following Python libraries are required:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- joblib
- nltk

These libraries can be installed using a Python package manager.

## Usage

The notebook guides you through loading a dataset of reviews, preprocessing the text, training a Naive Bayes model, and saving the trained model. The saved model can then be used to predict the sentiment of new customer reviews.
